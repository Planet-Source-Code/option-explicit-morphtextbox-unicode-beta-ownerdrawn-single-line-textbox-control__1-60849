Dear Matthew,
the famous function has been transformed into a boolean variable with the same name.
The value of the variable is assigned into the UserControl_Initialize event:

   '1) is NT 2) is Xp or above
   IsWinXPPlus = ((osv.dwPlatformID And VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT) = _
                 VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_NT) And _
                 ((osv.dwMajorVersion > 5) Or _
                 (osv.dwMajorVersion = 5) And (osv.dwMinorVersion >= 1))

Besides a flag to automatically read backward has been inserted in the function DrawText.
Its name is: DT_RTLREADING


I hope now it will work fine on both your systems... Excuse me for the time lost with this bug...:(
I added another text box and a charmap button, but just to test the above flag, you can remove them (not the flag).


That's all for now,
all the best,
Pietro
